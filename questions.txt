1.  This header defines a set of integral type aliases with specific width requirements,
    along with macros specifying their limits and macro functions to create values of these types.
2.  That is to save memory space. we only require 8 bits and we need to access 8 bits individually.
3.  BYTE->1 Byte
    DWORD->4 Bytes
    LONG->4 Bytes
    WORD->2 Bytes
4.  0x4d42 This specifies a BMP file type.
5.  bfSize is the total size of the image file including the metadata.
    biSize is the size occupied by the pixels and padding.
6.  negative biHeight means the origin is the top left corner.
    positive biHeight means the first triplet refers to the pixel in the lower left corner. 
7.  biBitCount.
8.  if fopen fails it will return NULL. 
    in line 24 it might happen due to non existance of infile.
    in line 32 it might be due to an invalid file name or directory.
9.  the third argument specifies the number of elements to be read.
    Since we are reading pixel by pixel, it is 1.
10. 3
11. It moves the file pointer in argument 1 by number of bytes specified in arg 2 from the pointer in arg 3.
12. The current position of the corresponding pointer.
